Localizations are now being managed via Crowdin: [https://crowdin.com/project/modular-avatar](https://crwd.in/modular-avatar/81d260e3f535f23038d3262b4c4aeb952464122)

When adding new strings, please add them directly to the `en-US.json` file as part of your pull request.
You may also add translated strings to the other language files; crowdin will automatically import them. Do not add
"untranslated" strings (i.e. copies of the en-US strings), unless the string is meant to be the same in the language
in question.

When making a change to just add a new string, please do so on crowdin instead. If you have any trouble getting access,
please contact me at bd_@nadena.dev and I'll try to get you set up.
